# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
# 12+22+...+102=385
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
# (1+2+...+10)2=552=3025
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640.
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
